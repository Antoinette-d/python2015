### Python notes and exercises

This repository contains IPython notebooks, scripts, modules and supporting files for the 2015 Bioinformatics Support Platform Python course. The notebooks can be viewed one of two ways:

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/pvanheus/python2015.git` to your computer and then start `ipython notebook` in the resulting `python2015` directory. This will let you work interactively with the contents of the notebooks, including examples. Note that the notebooks were created using [Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) (for Python 2.7). Also, for some of the notebooks you need to have BioPython installed.

2. View the notebooks using *nbviewer*. On GitHub, click on the notebook, copy the link to the notebook as reflected in the location bar of your browser, and paste that link into the form at http://nbviewer.ipython.org/.
